# Sticky Delta vs Sticky Strike in Equity Option Pricing

This project analyses implied volatility surface dynamics following spot moves
under sticky strike and sticky delta assumptions.

Using a stylised equity volatility surface and Black–Scholes pricing,
the project compares option prices, Greeks, and delta-hedged PnL,
highlighting practical implications for hedging on equity derivatives desks.
